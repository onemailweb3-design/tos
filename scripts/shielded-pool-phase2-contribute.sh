# One participant's whole part in the phase-2 ceremony.

#
# WHY IT BUILDS RATHER THAN SHIPPING A BINARY
#
#   Your contribution is worth something only if your scalar was destroyed,
#   and that is a property of source you can read -- not of a binary somebody
#   handed you. If you run a binary I built, the thing you are attesting to is
#   my honesty, which is exactly what your participation was supposed to
#   remove. So this builds, and you should read two short files first:
#
#       tools/shielded-pool-ceremony/src/secret.rs     (~110 lines)
#       tools/shielded-pool-ceremony/src/entropy.rs    (~170 lines)
#
#   They are the whole of the discipline. The scalar is drawn from
#   /dev/urandom inside contribute(), used, and wiped; it is not a return
#   value, not a parameter, and cannot be printed -- Secret has no Display and
#   its Debug prints a placeholder, so logging it is a compile error.
#
# WHY IT WILL NOT GENERATE A SIGNING KEY
#
#   A signature from a key nobody has seen before proves nothing: anyone can
#   make one and sign anything. The attestation is worth something because a
#   *known* person made it, so --sign-with must name a key that is already
#   publicly yours. If you have none, publish the text unsigned from an
#   account that is already yours; the identity comes from the account.
#
# WHAT TOUCHES YOUR DISK
#
#   The ceremony directory, which is public and carries no secret, and the
#   attestation, which you are about to publish. Nothing else.

I drew a scalar from my machine's random generator, applied it, and destroyed
it. I did not record it, copy it, or transmit it, and I do not have it.

The second digest names my position: every later contribution's challenge is
derived from it, so this record cannot be reordered, shortened or substituted
without invalidating what follows.
