//! How much of the pool's own tree work is Poseidon2 and how much is TVM.
//!
//! This is not a question about proof systems. Both of the pool's trees are
//! walked by FunC loops that hash with Poseidon2 and carry the result through
//! cells and dictionaries, and the measurement that showed a STARK's Merkle
//! path to be seven eighths bookkeeping applies here unchanged.
//!
//! The permutation counts are measured rather than read off the source, by
//! the method the Poseidon2 tariff work used: build the VM at a different
//! price, re-run, and divide the difference. Set `TOS_POSEIDON2_PRICE` to the
//! price the VM was built with.
