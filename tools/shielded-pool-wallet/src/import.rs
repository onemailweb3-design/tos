//! Section 3.1: turning a decrypted payload into a note, or refusing to.
//!
//! Decryption proves only that the payload was encrypted to this wallet's
//! ML-KEM key. It does not prove that the plaintext describes the note the
//! chain actually published: the payer wrote the plaintext, and the contract
//! never looked inside it. A relay cannot swap the bytes -- the hash is a
//! public input -- but the payer can put anything in them.
//!
//! So every field is checked against something outside the payload. The owner
//! and key hashes are checked against what this wallet's own index derives,
//! and the note the plaintext describes is rebuilt and checked against the
//! note body the transaction published, using the payload hash the *chain*
//! observed rather than one recomputed from the bytes in hand.
